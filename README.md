# MyReads App

First project made for the Udacity React Development Nanodegree. Initiated with the starter template [found here](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter).

### Installation

To install the project locally on your machine, lead your console prompt to the folder where the repository was cloned or downloaded. Then use this command:

```sh
$ npm install
```

Make sure to have npm installed on your machine.

### Running

To run the project you`ll have to start the local development serve. On the same path you used the install command, now use:

```sh
$ npm start
```

When the server is succesfully started, your default browser should open with the app already running. If it doesn't or if you want to open it on another tab or browser, access via `localhost:3000`.

To stop the server, `CTRL+C` keyboard command on the console prompt.
